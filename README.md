## Lore
31st century. Limits were overcome, barriers were shattered. The advancements in technology made possible by private
companies such as Galacticraft and Advanced Rocketry allowed humans to reach the extensions of what was previously
considered impossible. Finally, Mars was not only a dream, but a reality. Travelling between the two was almost
instantaneous, with rockets reaching near-c velocities. Yet again, this dream was destined to an end.  
A war of huge proportions sparked between Earth and what was once a planetary colony. The goal: conquering the
regions outside the asteroid belt, with rockets so powerful that they could withstand the impact of Ceres. I was in the Earth
army. We were fighting with all we've had, but the destruction was imminent. Weapons were too powerful, too strong for
us to even comprehend their destructive power. And then, the ultimate resource: a fusion bomb that made the old
Hiroshima and Nagasaki ones look like the smallest firework in the smallest firework display. We had four of them, but
suddenly there were only two. <br/>
I knew what was about to happen. I managed to escape the camp and started to run. I reached the nearest city and stole a
legacy model of rocket, made by a dead company known as SpaceX. While boarding it, I salvaged an old fusion reactor that
was nearby, a Molecular Transmutator, some saplings and seeds, and a book containing the molecular structure of all the
elements known to the human species. I barely escaped: behind me the two planets exploded like supernovae, leaving
nothing behind but groups of lifeless rocks. I directed the rocket to a nearby experimental space colony where I knew
there wasn't anybody. The rocket wasn't made to land though, so I decided to go for it and jumped into the emptiness of
space. My calculations were correct: I grabbed the external dome and made my way inside the structure. Now I am here,
all alone, last survivor for all I know of a species that once ruled the world and far beyond. But I must not give up:
I'll rebuild everything from scratch. I still don't believe I am the only human alive. I have to do this. I NEED to fix
that Reactor. For the human race, for my friends, for Max. <br/>

## Resource Generation
This pack uses a unique method of resource generation which will be using Energy's Matter, a custom mod being made for 
this pack by [TheSilkMiner](https://github.com/TheSilkMiner). In the early game, you will be able to transmute items and 
blocks into other items or blocks. However, it is not able to materialise any new items and is only able to materialise raw materials. 
As for the later stages of the game, you will scan an item and get a moecular schema of the item. This molecular schema can then 
be used with an immense amount of power to create the item with just energy. A more detailed explanation can be found 
[here](https://github.com/Redfire75369/FactorumUltimation/blob/master/docs/Energy's_Matter.md).

## Power Generation
The main form of power generation for the generation of resources will be within the same mod. In the beginning, you use heat differentials. 
Later, you will use fusion reactions to produce large amounts of energy. Then, you will advance to the next technological stage where you 
will use antimatter collisions and a dyson swarm around the sun for high energy but irregular and medium energy but regular power generation. 
In the endgame of the pack, you will harness the power of black holes to generate huge amounts of energy irregularly or very high amounts of 
energy continuously.
## Endgame
You are going to need to pull on aspects from every mod, even those not in the questline to craft things that break the fourth wall. 
Some other items that will be needed are 4th dimensional items, all the  forms of elementary particles, rare elements such as 
Krypton, Hafnium, Thulium, Darmstadtium, Oganesson, etc.
