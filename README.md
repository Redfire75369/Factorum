## Lore
31st century. Limits were overcome, barriers were shattered. The advancements in technology made possible by private
companies such as Galacticraft and Advanced Rocketry allowed humans to reach the extensions of what was previously
considered impossible. Finally, Mars was not only a dream, but a reality. Travelling between the two was almost
instantaneous, with rockets reaching near-c velocities. Yet again, this dream was destined to an end.  
A war of huge proportions sparked between Earth and the what was once a planetary colony. The goal: conquering the
regions outside the asteroid belt, with rockets so powerful that could withstand the impact of Ceres. I was in the Earth
army. We were fighting with all we've had, but the destruction was imminent. Weapons were too powerful, too strong for
us to even comprehend their destructive power. And then, the ultimate resource: a fusion bomb that made the old
Hiroshima and Nagasaki ones look like the smallest firework in the smallest firework display. We had four of them, but
suddenly there were only two. <br/>
I knew what was about to happen. I managed to escape the camp and started to run. I reached the nearest city and stole a
legacy model of rocket, made by a dead company known as SpaceX. While boarding it, I salvaged an old fusion reactor that
was nearby, a Molecular Transmutator, some saplings and seeds, and a book containing the molecular structure of all the
elements known to the human species. I barely escaped: behind me the two planets exploded like supernovae, leaving
nothing behind but groups of lifeless rocks. I directed the rocket to a nearby experimental space colony where I knew
there wasn't anybody. The rocket wasn't made to land though, so I decided to go for it and jumped into the emptiness of
space. My calculations were correct: I grabbed the external dome and made my way inside the structure. Now I am here,
all alone, last survivor for all I know of a species that once ruled the world and far beyond. But I must not give up:
I'll rebuild everything from scratch. I still don't believe I am the only human alive. I have to do this. I NEED to fix
that Reactor. For the human race, for my friends, for Max. <br/>

## Endgame
