# Factorum Ultimation: Expert
## This is a repository for the Modpack Factorum Ultimation.
This is a skyblock modpack for 1.12.
### Energy's Matter
#### Resource Generation
- You'll need a 2x2 section that is the reaction chamber, where a small amount of particles get used in a nuclear reaction.
- Those particles are added to the chamber with a particle injector, which needs power to work and particles reserves.
- The generator outputs one item to a nearby inventory (up, down, clockwise).
- The controller requires a molecular schema so that it can combine the items. That molecular schema needs to be created from another machine and consumes a certain quantity of items according to the difficulty settings and the complexity of it.
- Fusion Reactor
  - Materials Required
    - Cooling Pumps (1 to 3){3 Tiers}
      - Tiers Varying on Efficiency and Power Required
    - Injector (Not Needed if Particle Storage is used)
      - Injects Particles from a Collector Extremely Slowly
    - Particle Storage {2 Tiers}
      - Tier 1: Uses <sup>2</sup>H and <sup>3</sup>H
      - Tier 2: Uses C, N and O
    - Power Controller {1 Tier}
      - Distributes power to the multi block
    - Reactor Control Panel {1 Tier}
      - Controls the Multiblock, the Reaction Status, Shutting Down Mechanisms and More
    - Exhaust Pipes (0 to 4)
      - If Present, Augement the Efficiency of Cooling and Speed of the Reactor
    - Output pipe
