# Factorum Ultimation: Expert
## This is a repository for the Modpack Factorum Ultimation.
This is a skyblock modpack for 1.12.
**Note:** This Pack is still a Work In Progress.

### Lore
31st century. Limits were overcome, barriers were shattered. The advancements in technology made possible by private companies such as Galacticraft
and Advanced Rocketry allowed humans to reach the extensions of what was previously considered impossible. Finally, Mars was not only a dream, but a
reality. Travelling between the two was almost instantaneous, with rockets reaching near-c velocities. Yet again, this dream was destined to an end. <br />
A war of huge proportions sparked between Earth and the what was once a planetary colony. The goal: conquering the regions outside the asteroid belt,
with rockets so powerful that could withstand the impact of Ceres. I was in the Earth army. We were fighting with all we've had, but the destruction
was imminent. Weapons were too powerful, too strong for us to even comprehend their destructive power. And then, the ultimate resource: a fusion bomb
that made the old Hiroshima and Nagasaki ones look like the smallest firework in the smallest firework display. We had four of them, but suddenly there
were only two. <br />
I knew what was about to happen. I managed to escape the camp and started to run. I reached the nearest city and stole a legacy model
of rocket, made by a dead company known as SpaceX. While boarding it, I salvaged an old fusion reactor that was nearby, a Molecular Transmutator, some
saplings and seeds, and a book containing the molecular structure of all the elements known to the human species. I barely escaped: behind me the two
planets exploded like supernovae, leaving nothing behind but groups of lifeless rocks. I directed the rocket to a nearby experimental space colony
where I knew there wasn't anybody. The rocket wasn't made to land though, so I decided to go for it and jumped into the emptiness of space. My
calculations were correct: I grabbed the external dome and made my way inside the structure. Now I am here, all alone, last survivor for all I know of
a species that once ruled the world and far beyond. But I must not give up: I'll rebuild everything from scratch. I still don't believe I am the only
human alive. I have to do this. I NEED to fix that Reactor. For the human race, for my friends, for Max. 

### Endgame
The Ingot that transcends reality itself and the Gem that shatters the fabric of the universe, combined forming something that breaks all Boundaries.

## Mod Information
### Energy's Matter
#### Resource Generation
- A 2x2 section will be used as the reaction chamber, where a small amount of particles get used in a nuclear reaction.
- The particles are added to the chamber with a particle injector, which passively injects particles from the surroundings into the chamber for a small input of power or a Particle Storage, which injects large quantities of particles in at once but requires an external source of particles.
- The generator outputs one item to a nearby inventory (up, down, clockwise).
- The controller requires a molecular schema so that it can combine the items. That molecular schema needs to be created from another machine and consumes a certain quantity of items according to the difficulty settings and the complexity of it.
