## Modular Machinery
**Note:** More Modular Machines are already planned but are spoilers for the later portion of the pack.
### Alchemical Transmutator
Uses the power of alchemy to break the laws of physics

### Alloy Basin
Mixes molten fluids into stronger, harder and more complex alloys

### Bio-Nutritous Chamber
The Bio-Nutritous Chamber uses Mana to infuse the crops and increase the growth speed and yield immensely.
- Inputs
  - Mana
- Building Materials
  - Botania: Natura Pylon * 1
  - ContentTweaker: Biological Plating * 20
  - Glassential: Luminous Glass * 88

### Blast Chiller
Uses a vacuum to rapidly cool down molten fluids to a low temperature

### Cryogenic Freezer

### Induction Furnace
Uses the heat of a star to melt things down to their molten forms

### Lathe
The Lathe uses Mechanical Power and a motor to cut and shape an ingot into rods, yielding in 8 rods per ingot. Some rods are also too strong to make in any other manner.
